## Summary:-
In the process of cleaning the dataset, I used the Pandas and Numpy libraries. Using pandas and NumPy I removed unwanted (useless) data and created new data frames and got useful data for my research. After cleaning my data I used seaborn and Matplotlib libraries to visualize and read my data. I have created questions regarding my research. I have tried to solve them by imagining and applying the conditions.
